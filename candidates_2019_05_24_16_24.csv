 I managed the yield on the network with a team of 3 Ph.D data scientists and 3 engineers, and report to the CTO & CEO 
Some of the problems that my team identified, and solved through analytics are 
	•	Targeting ads to 2B users is not manageable manually . Created a set of  “persona verticals” based on the mobile apps they use.  Examples of personas are traveller, shopper, parent etc.  
	•	There are 800K + apps, and they monetize differently. We developed a fine segmentation of apps space based on their textual descriptions. This means instead of spending test advertising on each app individually, it is enough to learn across a segment of apps. This results in cost savings of several million dollars
	•	Publisher fraud and Bots prevented the business from scaling through selfserve.  We developed a model that used a form of logistic regression to flag unusual self serve registrations. 
	•	Increased monetization of the network, though various user profiling and Time series algorithms to exploit yield changes over hour of day as well as day of week","Co-Founder and CTO,  Million Levers  - Apple & Game Show Network (Bash Gaming Studio) , 2012-2014

• I developed a streaming platform for collecting and analyzing EEG data from test subjects and later expanded the platform for collecting IoT sensor data, logs and video data.

• Data was published to and from Kafka over MQTT. This required building custom Kafka connectors (Java/Scala) and deploying a highly available linearly scalable Kafka cluster backed by Zookeeper.

• I Implemented several real-time analysis algorithms using Kafka Streams. I also connected Apache Spark running as a cluster and consuming messages from Kafka to utilize the streaming SparkML functionality.

• Data was also published to a GPU cluster using ZeroMQ (C++) over UDP. The cluster could run Theano, Tensor Flow and OpenCL (C++) for custom machine vision algorithms. 

• All components, even the OpenCL engine which required direct GPU access, were containerized with Docker, built and unit tested within Jenkins for CI then published as images where they could be deployed on demand to production with Rancher (itself setup using Terraform). This was all hosted with AWS though it was designed to be portable to any hosting platform.

• Using Rancher any component in the system could be scaled up in seconds.

• As VP of Data Science at Lucy.ai I developed several natural language algorithms with NLTK to determine the intent within email, identify where an 'ask' was taking place, and extract the people engaged in the email along with a rich data set describing their contact information. 

• I Utilized the scikit-learn library to train models with data extracted from the NLP framework and classify years of email content.

• I also developed an infinitely scalable platform, utilizing SQS queueing and S3 storage, high throughput Java components, intelligent Python components utilizing the wealth of libraries available, a Node.js API built for high performance asynchronous access and a data store comprised of DynamoDB, ElasticSearch and even a Graph Database (Neo4j) spanning multiple servers.

• I also developed all of the components using Docker and was able to create a simulation of the entire production system on my laptop in less than a minute.

• The system I developed over a handful of months was highly robust, real-time, responsive and able to manage millions of data items per hour without any sense of limitation.","Senior Data Consultant, iSentia, 2013-2015

As well as Singapore based Brandtology and other iSentia assets based in China.

• I proactively initiated a federated search project, worked with relevant stakeholders across the Asia-Pacific and Led a team of five engineers to complete the project  in just six months, after which the company executed a successful $500,000,000 IPO.

• The system developed at BuzzNumbers scaled seamlessly to the much larger demands of the iSentia product group.

• Consulting continued in an advisory role and to provide training and support as the team was transitioned in-house","CTO, Buzz Numbers, 2010-2013
As CTO I was instrumental in the company's technical development, from the initial founding until the successful acquisition by iSentia.

BuzzNumbers is a social media monitoring service that collects thousands of online mentions every second. Each mention is then matched against hundreds of thousands of complex queries for a range of international clients. The platform provides real-time search and multi-dimensional reports across all collected data.

Responsibilities included designing the architectural blueprint for the platform, in addition to managing and hiring the software development team, as well as project managing the agile development cycle.

Further responsibility included a DevOps role to keep the system running 24/7 during times of exceptional  growth.

Success in this role required technical mastery of many skills including:

• Successfully leading a team of ten engineers and developers

• Queuing platforms for stream processing the high quantity of collected data and dealing with traffic bursts (RabbitMQ, PubNub, WebSockets)

• Custom development of cloud scaling platforms, including configuration, security and deployment (Storm, Dome9)

• Realtime filtering of content according to non-trivial user submitted queries (Elastic Search)

• Natural language processing and analysis of collected content, including sentiment and topic discovery (Python)

• Developing patented algorithms to quickly determine the geographic origin of content based on their meta data and text (C#)

• Utilising scalable, searchable and distributed cloud storage for billions of records with real-time indexation and multi-dimensional analysis capabilities.

This required utilizing Objective C for the iPhone, J2me for Java enabled phones, C++ for Symbian and Mono-touch to leverage the C# code base for Android.• Mokoki users needed the ability to quickly search for friends, events and places within geographic regions. This required the development of a custom search engine and indexer for efficient retrieval of data based on both textual and spatial keys.• A novel dynamic markup language similar to HTML was also developed, which could be deployed to the various mobile platforms and run using custom interpreters with rich and responsive native code. • A leaner network layer was also developed to improve on the standard interface provided by the phones.

Sales: Drove $4.8M Increase in Yearly Billings Through Engagement Model Refactor
• Measured Sales impact vs control by customer type and refocused four reps on customers where they provide the greatest uplift.  Ground-up quota refactor to support new engagement model
• Reps responsible for ~$120M in billings over two years, and have attained 103% of quota to-date

Product Management: Deeper Understanding of Monthly Active User (MAU) Metric
• Designed “MAU Flow” reporting to facilitate diagnosis of MAU fluctuations.  Breaks changes into Inflows and Outflows, simplifying root cause analysis of changes in the overall MAU number
• Building “Engagement Score” to measure depth of customer engagement (in progress).  Using k-means clustering and event data to group customers into different levels of engagement

Marketing: Behavioral Marketing Programs With 1M+ Customer Reach
• Partnered with Marketing to design, implement, and A/B test four outbound, behavioral Marketing email programs to encourage best practices in app development

TL;DR: I managed teams of Analysts in day-to-day analytical and client deliverable responsibilities, supporting expert witnesses in eight mortgage-backed security cases with damages claims up to $1.2B 

What I did generally:
•	Work with AG team and expert witness to determine relevant analyses for the given litigation
•	Compile, analyze, and present complex qualitative and quantitative data
•	Develop and specify statistical models to support expert witness testimony
•	Provide critiques of opposing experts' methodologies and resulting conclusions

Example projects:
•	Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan Performance Cases: led teams of analysts in benchmarking payment performance of mortgage loans in eight MBS cases.  End-to-end project ownership: compiled and standardized data, specified and ran statistical models, interpreted results for senior management and expert witnesses, and provided support for expert witness testimony.
•	Mortgage-Backed Securities Sampling Case: assessed reliability of statistical sampling methodologies proposed by opposing expert, including empirical tests of margin of error and sample representativeness.  This resulted in the court throwing out the opposing expert’s proposed sampling methodology.
•	Patent Portfolio Valuation Case: designed and drew random sample of patents for valuation in an intellectual property case, allowing the overall IP portfolio to be valued while meeting tight case deadlines.","Data Science & Analytics, Heroku, 2015-

We use data to translate goals and hypotheses into actionable intelligence and execution on projects that move the needle on business objectives, partnering with stakeholders across Heroku to maximize our impact.

 Example Projects
 • Customer Segmentation: holistic customer use case segmentation of Heroku’s 1M+ users, joining product usage, billings, and user demographic data to better understand who our customers are and how they use Heroku’s platform.
 • Internal Dashboards: built Looker dashboards to surface company KPIs, increase cost visibility and promote containment, and track new product adoption.
 • Sales Rep Impact Assessment: conducted analysis of sales rep performance across various opportunity types, which led to a complete reallocation of sales efforts to focus on areas of highest rep impact.
 • Sales Rep Quotas: used revenue forecast model (see below) to set yearlong quotas for sales reps responsible for over $70M in yearly billings, aligning rep incentives with the well-being of Heroku’s business as a whole.
 • Looker Ownership: responsible for improving and servicing Heroku’s Looker model, promoting Looker usage within the organization, onboarding new hires in using Looker, and interfacing with Looker account management.

Brion Technologies, a subsidiary of ASML US Inc, produces a simulation platform called the
Tachyon, which simulates the ASML's photo-lithography machines. The Tachyon platform is based
on a highly accurate empirical model which, after calibration using wafer CD measurements, can
predict contours of real layout with high fidelity. The optical part of the model is based on the
Hopkins' theory which requires computation of 2D Fourier transforms. I had researched the
applicability of the sparse FFT algorithms to improve the performance of this part of the model.
The resist model is a linear combination of a set of term images. New terms may be added to
improve accuracy but a systematic study is required to understand the effects of the new terms. I
am performing this study.","Application Support Engineer, The MathWorks, 2005-2007

This work involved the development of a method to calculate the contribution of each of the 10 emission sources (e.g. transport, lightning, biomass burning, etc) present in the model to the concentration of HOx(OH and HO2) for a coupled climate-chemistry model (CCM) E39/C. A set of 116 chemical equations were considered from the MECCA mechanism module to compute the concentration of HOx by using box-model studies and a probability approach for each of the chemical reactions considered. An error analysis was performed and the method was found to be effective showing less than 4% error for both OH and HO2 concentration. The nature and extent to which each reaction contributes towards certain high and low concentrations for all emission sources was also studied. The system was also simplified to a set of 12 equations by finding the extent of contribution of each of the reaction towards HOx concentration to make the computation easier with good accuracy.","Indian Academy of Sciences Summer Research Fellow, Indian Institute of Science, 2008-2008

Worked on data analytics research project in collaboration with Citi Group, Dublin to find the key indicators of behavioral changes (in terms of evolution of the balance sheet size and portfolio structure) in banks, contributing to the results of regulatory financial stress testing. Tools: R programming and Tableau. Methodologies: Statistical modelling, Logistic Regression.

Abstract
Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2011 resulted in failure of many financial institutions like Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. After GFC, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and many worldwide regulatory/governing authorities focused on the implementation of a standardised framework for enhancing the ability of banking sector to withstand financial or economic crisis. This standardised framework, Third Basel Accord (Basel III), mainly concerns with stress testing, capital adequacy requirement and market liquidity risk. With the help of different financial indicators like capital, risk profile etc., regulatory stress testing assesses the ability of financial institutions to withstand financial and economic crisis. Changes in these indicators show certain banking behaviour in anticipation of regulatory stress testing. This study tries to find such key indicators of banking behavioural changes contributing to the results of EU wide regulatory stress testing conducted in 2014.","Senior Software Engineer, Tieto, 2010-2014

Cybersecurity Professor with a focus on software development.","Senior Software Developer, Monsanto Company, 2014-2016
As a member of the Product Assets team, colloquially called GraphRoots, I (1) contributed to the design and implementation of a reactive archictecture for streaming data out of legacy data stores into newer database architectures, (2) developed APIs for monitoring of the streaming architecture, (3) deployed a search API for our newly aggregated data stores, and (4) created an app for visualizing corn breeding ancestry. Within BioTech my role focused in three areas: (1) full-stack development for new applications used within BioTech R&D labs, (2) maintaining and improving existing user interfaces used in those labs, and (3) providing architecture and technology strategy for future lab application development.","Ph.D. Candidate, Washington University in St. Louis, 2005-2014
I focused my research on developing and studying programming environments for introductory programmers. This started with JPie (http://dsys.cse.wustl.edu/projects.html) an Java IDE that provided a drag-and-drop interface for program construction and live code evaluation to make programming a more direct learning experience. I later transitioned to Looking Glass (http://lookingglass.wustl.edu/) an IDE designed to motivate middle school students to learn programming independently. Centered on Looking Glass, my thesis topic involved enabling code reuse for non-programmers. The principal questions were about designing an interface for people who had never programmed before that enabled them to (1) identify what part of a program's code did something interesting, (2) select the code of interest, and (3) reuse that code in the context of something interesting to them. Ideally this encouraged a user, or in this instance a middle school student, to learn programming by helping them identify and reuse examples they found stimulating.","Computer Science Professor, Blackburn College, 2012-2013

Methods: Panel discussion with stakeholders, Data integration of CMS claim data, SQL query, statistics aggregation, tableau visualization and statistical modeling. 

Business insight: optimize regional Accountable Care Organazation (ACO)'s financial performance and primary care quality by helping them identify and engage those Primary Care Physicians, who induced excessive avoidable costs and patient leakage to out-of-network facility/specialist; identify those severe patients for care management to reduce their future avoidable cost and leakage.

2, Data integration of de-identified healthcare databases and patient expenditure analysis.
Content:
Data integration of hospital inpatient data sets, e.g., combined information from clinical, administrative and billing sources. Investigation of the factors associated with/helping predict the patient in-hospital total expenditure, death event and length of stay. I compared the results from multiple ML/statistical algorithms (Linear Model with stepwise model selection by AIC criterion, Elastic Net regularized linear regression, Group based MCP regularized linear regression, Random Forest and Quantile Regression.). I observed some caveats of the data set (e.g., multicollinearity among several explanatory variables, heterogeneous variance of residuals and non-linear effect between some explanatory variables and the response variable - total charges) and proposed a few alternative models robust to these caveats. I verified pros and cons of currently executed algorithms for this data set. I interpreted the outputs, draw statistical inferences and have a discussion of variables' importance to predicting total expenditure and other response variables.","Research Biostatistician, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), 2011-2015

Defined and built (end-to-end) an automated multi-channel behavioural retargeting programme in SQL Server that executed in Exact Target. In the 6 months post-rollout this v1 iteration delivered uplift in site CTR, purchase and revenue of over 10% in each case, equating to incremental revenue of £250k. Documented and provided recommendations for v2 prior to leaving the company.

 Undertook a deep-dive project looking at the relationship between the key “initiation events” of user loyalty (return visit, first purchase and repeat purchase) and the factors that influenced their occurrence (e.g. offer coverage) then modelled would-be gains in revenue and customer retention if the business was to, for instance, increase the offer coverage of a certain brand by X%.

 Scoped, designed and built a dashboard (inc. underlying data sources) for the CRM team to monitor performance of individual communications as well as entire programmes, and then corroborate numbers with their operational scorecard.

 Following the soft-launch of geo-fence & CRM push notifications for our app I created an interactive report and ran various pieces of strategic insight relating to such things as lead-time (time to enter store/area fence), dwell-time (time in store/area fence) and mitigation of push unsubcribes.

 Was heavily involved in business planning/forecasting for 2015 and 2016 with the UK MD, US Head of Business Development and Head of EU, preparing, sharing and discussing high-level, state-of-the-business insights pertaining to acquisition performance and CRM strategy.

 Scoped, built and stress-tested a bespoke audience builder tool in SQL to allow the CRM Manager and executives to effortlessly and autonomously produce audience lists based on a multitude of criteria in combination. Through empowering the team and saving them time the tool has enabled an increase in the diversity, timeliness and frequency of their communications.","Lead Insight Analyst, ITG Creator Ltd, 2012-2014

 Regularly met with Nectar analysts to devise new ways to increase loyalty scheme participation through cross-channel communications. This involved using the data to target lapsed Sainsbury’s customers whose Nectar points balance is actively changing, and also reaching out to non-participating online customers who do participate in physical stores.

 Developed means of reducing printed Coupon-at-Till wastage (cost to the business of approx £6m/year) via early identification of low redemption rates, better targeting of customers using offer engagement segmentation and protection against over-printing (1 day latency between campaign shut off and cessation of printing) by predicting when the budgeted prints volume will be met.","Senior Customer Analyst, thetrainline.com, 2011-2012

Chosen to architect a BI solution within XBOX Security, built an automated solution with only Microsoft products and within a challenging, secure environment that is not part of the corporate domain. With no data platform in existence to support security operations and multiple teams using multiple data-capturing tools, built an automated dashboard solution utilizing SQL languages that are used today for executive reviews along with scorecards and required analysis.

Accomplishments:

Security Incident Management was running tool from a desktop server with no reporting capabilities. Led a migration to a tented collaboration environment housed in an MS datacenter for reliability and scalability. Built from ground zero an automated dashboard with slicing capabilities, SSRS with subscriptions (and on-demand live data) all while providing data security to select audiences. This has now been onboarded to an Azure SQL warehouse with a Power BI automated platform and solution.

Executive leadership requested a one year forecast of crypto-web volume and the amount of new server hardware that would be required. Utilizing predictive analytics based upon historical volume and predicted new feature attributes; provided 4 models with a recommended model that required no new funding. This was implemented successfully with a cost avoidance over $1M.

Security Operations Monitoring team was spending cycles on chasing admin account checkouts via ERPM when the results always ended in being noise. Analyzed data from ArcSight monitoring to determine patterns of when accounts across (8) domains were being checked out. Statistical analysis delivered recommendations on detection creation based upon probability of time of day and the number of checkouts which reduced team churn and improved detection quality, and has been a standard onboarding model baseline for other new solutions.","Windows Azure Support Program Manager, Microsoft, 2009-2013
Own, drive and deliver the overall quality of support for the Windows Azure Platform for Microsoft’s most critical enterprise customers and partners. Built and maintained a methodology that would rely on quality-driven principles with identified primary areas of focus towards the customer.

Accomplishments:

Windows Azure (Microsoft’s Platform as a Service solution) required integration with the current commercial support processes for customers to allow for both paid technical support and non-paid administrative support. Worked directly with engineering teams across multiple organizations driving process flows supporting business requirements to ensure a seamless customer experience once released. The end result was a live purchase authentication process that is customer-focused globally in nine languages with continuous improvements and new service releases being launched on a monthly basis.

Forecasting support volume month-over-month was not accurate and at best, a ‘lucky guess’. Over time, mathematically engineered a predictive model based upon subscription growth with existing support volume, identifying very strong relationships by way of regression testing. Today, there is an equation to be used that will assist in financial and operational readiness and based upon statistical methods using financial forecasts as the predictor.

Overall satisfaction with Azure Support customers was not easily obtainable without any known drivers. Analyzing existing Voice of the Customer data displayed a strong correlation between engineer satisfaction with the customer and the overall satisfaction of the customer. Built a mathematical simulation model that drove a change in metrics and measurements focusing on the inputs of commercial support that now readily predict overall customer satisfaction with leading indicators that can successfully be mitigated during the customer experience.","Strategy & Planning Manager, Microsoft, 2007-2009
Currently performing business manager and process quality functions within the Product & Price Data Governance (PPDG) organization at Microsoft dedicated to strategic management of the business and identifying process deficiencies with detailed data analysis accompanied with planning for correction.  Commitments include owning and driving the Rhythm Of the Business for Lisa Reller and her Leadership Team, dotted-line report to Operations Services Chief of Staff, improving Employee Satisfaction, optimizing FTE resources thru 6 Sigma Black Belt Project, and Scorecard Ownership, Build and Management for Organization.  This position did not exist previously.

Accomplishments
Theory was that organization was not operating efficiently.  Owned and executed 6 Sigma Project focused on identifying all process tasks and cycle time spent performing non-value add and redundant work. Findings identified opportunities to reduce cycle time by (minimum) 200 hours per week with actual savings being 4 FTE headcount.

FY08 Employee Satisfaction results were low in key areas.  Improvement efforts utilized Six Sigma methodologies, targeting two specific areas of focus.  FY09 results included increase of 21% and 17% in the %Favorable category for the two targeted areas. Overall %Favorable increased 17% (64% to 81%). * Published company-wide best practice for improving workgroup collaboration.

Pricing Operations organization did not have a leading indicator for Partner Satisfaction.  Identified Key Problem Indicators (KPIs) by interviewing SMEs and key stakeholders.  Engineered a new metric based upon data analysis that is now a Tier 1 metric for VP in FY10 and is a leading indicator of Partner Satisfaction.","Research Program Manager, Microsoft, 2006-2007
Selected to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle team tasked to collect qualitative and quantitative Voice Of the Customer data pertaining to custom product support, extended product support, and improving the current product support lifecycle policy.

This position did not exist previously.

Accomplishments
Microsoft did not have any Voice Of the Customer data in regards to product support lifecycle.  With 100K budget, executed project that delivered both quantitative and qualitative information, including competitive products. Results of study aided in Executive decision making around our product support policies.

Limited product hotfix release trending information existed within the Windows Client Product Group.  Collaborated directly with Windows Client Senior Developers to build out hotfix release model.  This information was used at the Executive level (Microsoft Support Lifecycle Review Board) to improve existing operating system support policy.

Detailed revenue reporting for custom and extended hotfix support did not exist. Drove detailed reports at the program level by product.  This allowed the discontinuation of programs that were not profitable.","Other Accomplishments, Microsoft, 2000-2006
Limited number of 6 Sigma Black Belts in Operations Services meant a risk of decisions being made without proper information.  Selected to enter Microsoft Quality &amp; Business Excellence Black Belt Program.  Immediate gains noticed around information quality allowing informed business decisions.No 6 Sigma Green Belts in Product Support Services (Charlotte) in 2004.  Selected to participate in Green Belt program and assigned improvement project within PSS.  Drove consistent case-logging processes in Developer Support that aligned with Windows and Exchange Support Teams, decreasing Minutes Per Incident (case labor) in cases 21 days and older by an average of 100 minutes; bug cases reduced by average of 4 days.With Microsoft beginning to offshore and globally expand select support offerings, Internet Information Services Support did not exist in Bangalore, India. Chosen to be one of a few select support engineers to interview, hire and train newly created support team.  This aligned to Microsoft’s strategy – Global Reach, which allowed for global coverage of Microsoft customers in the Americas and redundancy in other regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Analytics, business intelligence, business process improvement, certified firearms instructor, Change Management, cloud computing, crm, cross-functional team leadership, customer experience, customer satisfaction, data analysis, data science, faa licensed pilot, forecasting, glock armorer, it strategy, leadership, mdx, Minitab, monte carlo simulation, pmp, predictive modeling, process improvement, product management, program management, project planning, project portfolio management, regression models, saas, six sigma, software project management, sql azure, statistical modeling, strategy, T-SQL, windows azure","General Education, Eastern Kentucky University, 1986-1988","Applied Mathematics, Lindsey Wilson College, 1989-1990",,,,,,,,,,,,

As a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Engineering, I split time between developing the MIT Department of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautic's first massive open online course (MOOC) entitled 16.100x: Introduction to Aerodynamics and developing the MIT On-campus Educational System (MIToces). MIToces is a web application demonstrating the networked interconnectivity of modular learning outcomes in the MIT engineering curriculum. It was a natural follow-on to Crosslinks, a topic-based pre/post-requisite mapping wiki, which I also co-founded.","Graduate Research Assistant, MIT Aerospace Computational Design Laboratory, 2007-2013
During my doctoral and masters studies, I contributed to research in computational science and engineering in several ways. I developed new goal-oriented inference algorithms that exploit final design goals to accelerate solution of large-scale inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations. Theoretical foundations were established in the context of linear systems and an effective approach for nonlinear systems was demonstrated. I also developed a new method for model reduction that reduces parameter space in systems with high-dimensional parametric inputs; as a result, statistical inference approaches like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) were then possible. These research thrusts led to numerous publications in top research journals in the field including the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, SIAM Review, and International Journal of Numerical Methods in Fluids.","Mathematics & Modeling Group Intern, Schlumberger Doll Research Center, 2009-2009

Travellers come from many different paths, and at Booking.com, we deal with millions upon millions of travelers.  What's crucially important to one might be irrelevant to another.  Being a site which is responsible for 1MM+ room nights booked every day, personalization - showing the right content to the right users at the right time - is a critical component of our continued success.

My teams and I are fiercely customer-focused.  In our first 12 months, we have achieved the following:
* Returned a faltering product team back to gold standard performance levels
* Built the technology base on which a personalization engine can be built, consequently expanding the data science capabilities of the entire organization tremendously
* Performed qualitative and quantitative user research studies to uncover traveler decision drivers
* Successfully democratized data science, enabling dozens of teams to exploit the benefits of machine learning, without the need for additional staffing

Project Abstract: Image was modeled with conformed dimensions. All the master data except ‘Time’ comes to IMAGE from a MDM, as flat files. These extracts are loaded into a single set of dimension tables in one of the federated warehouses, which is subsequently replicated into all the other warehouses. Time dimension data is loaded into IMAGE once every year. Once the forthcoming year’s calendar is finalized it is sent to IMAGE by the business. In IMAGE we have developed a set of procedures & ETL’s to load these calendars into the corresponding Time dimension tables. Modifications were made in the master loading process to align with the migration of the MDM. The complete master loading system is highly efficient, optimized and fully automated. The loading process is completed every night before the fact loading commences with minimal or no human interference. The process sends auto mailers to IT officers in charge of the maintenance of the masters.

Rachel,Wagner-Kaiser,"Fellow at Insight Data Science","Insight Data Science","Seattle, WA, United States","Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Florida, 2017-2017
-- Led three different projects to analyze data from images of star clusters, with goal of attaining more precise absolute and relative measurements of the characteristics of these objects.
-- Compared theoretical models to observed data to gain 2x improvement over previous measurements (age, distance, composition, etc.).
-- Used previously developed Bayesian analysis software to analyze new observations of these objects.
-- Placed all results in context of broader picture by comparing behavior of clusters from another galaxy to those in our own galaxy.","Florida Space Science Grant Fellow, University of Florida, 2014-2016
-- Applied Bayesian techniques to 70 star clusters (100,000+ stars each) to learn more about the parameters driving variations the multiple population characteristics.
-- Assisted in the development and application of the Bayesian analysis software to analyze the characteristics multiple populations in clusters of stars by comparing multi-dimensional observations to multi-dimensional theoretical models.
-- Incorporated sparse ancillary data sources (spectroscopy) to further examine the differences between populations in the clusters.
-- Used results to provide feedback and inform proposed formation theories and scenarios for cluster formation.
-- Worked as part of an international, multi-disciplinary collaboration.
-- Designed successful proposals for funding and observations.
-- Developed, lead, and participated in 7 educational outreach programs.
-- Mentored colleagues and students in astronomical and statistical analysis techniques.","Graduate Research Assistant, University of Florida, 2013-2014
-- Led, managed, and collaborated to publish 5 first author papers unrelated to my thesis research.
-- Analyzed >50,000+ time-variable stars using chi-minimization template fitting in order to understand the formation and evolution history of the host galaxy. Supplemented this project upon a recent public data release to analyze the interaction history of two galaxies using the same category of variable objects.
-- Correlated catalogs of 1000+ time-variable stars based on location and brightness. Although distances are difficult to derive in astronomy, leveraged modern measurements were used to derive 2x more precise determinations of galactic distances.
-- Developed a custom nearest-neighbor analysis to attribute ages to 100,000+ individual objects from a grid of non-analytic theoretical models. Analyzed spatial distribution of the ages to determine how long a ""hole"" of stellar formation had persisted, which largely contradicts canonical galactic formation theories.
-- All projects involved cleaning or re-formatting messy, incomplete data from multiple sources. Projects were largely analyzed in Python or R, with data wrangling occasionally in Unix/bash.","Graduate Teaching Assistant, University of Florida, 2011-2013

Pindrop Security, an Andreessen-Horowitz funded startup, stops phone fraud using a combination of audio analysis of phone calls and other kinds of metadata in the phone ecosystem. I started out as Pindrop's first data scientist, and over a period of two years, grew the data science team to four full-time members, in addition to managing several contractors and interns. Some of my accomplishments there:

* Improved our risk scoring formula for phone calls using a data-driven approach to reduce the false positive rate. For our biggest financial client, this new formula reduced the false positive rate by 40%, thereby saving fraud analyst time required to review those calls.

* Developed an algorithm to analyze Call Detail Record (CDR) data and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) state information to detect reconnaissance activity in IVR systems that serve as an early warning of fraud (specifically, account takeover) attempts. Presented this work at BlackHat 2014, and obtained a provisional patent. This work is currently being productized at Pindrop and being tested with development partners.

* Improved our Phone Reputation Service (PRS) algorithm to detect phone spam (i.e. telemarketing and other unwanted calls), which has resulted in sales of the service to several new customers.

* Grew the data science team from one to four full-time members. Managed 3 interns in both summer 2014 and summer 2015. Provide both tactical management (day-to-day tasks, priorities) for my team, as well as strategic vision.","Applied Researcher, Damballa, Inc., 2012-2013

In the field of Information Retrieval and Machine Learning, the topic of the thesis was:
Online Techniques to find sub-trending phrases in Streaming Documents:

Real world events are almost always being discussed and in some cases, documented, on various popular
social networks online as hashtags. Hashtags are the Internet’s analogues of topics which are popular among users at the present instant of time. The choice of the text used to represent the hashtag is often highly contextual on some outstanding characteristics of the real world event, and is often derived from vernacular or common parlance and thus incognizant of the central aspects of the real world event. We thus are encountered with many hashtags which though represent the same real world event, but have seemingly unrelated names. This problem of finding definition of a trend is unique in its chief constraint of being dynamic due to constant evolution of the real world event. Thus a procedure to identify the main aspects of a trending event should also be temporally sensitive to shift their result along with the development of the event in the real world with the passage of time. We discuss an approach to identify such candidate representative phrases through identifying trends within trends, to mean that if certain phrases are being observed frequently within a time interval, they must represent a contemporary topic of rising interest among the documents being generated at the time.

This technique gives emphasis to various aspects of the trending event which are analogous to sub-events within the main event. One of the cornerstones of the technique is to maintain an online mode of operation, with a methodology to observe and process the incoming stream of documents only once. This also makes it practicable to most real world scenarios where information systems consume feeds from various sources and ingest various forms of metadata to enhance their processes of information extraction.","Software Engineering Intern, SmartFocus, 2014-2014

My current position focuses on quantitative predicting and forecasting in two areas: credit risk and financial marketing. This includes leading A.I. initiatives aimed at high-impact operational problems. 

Within credit risk management, I spearhead real-time identification and tracking of risk volatility due to irregular, negative sentiments from financial influencers. Among my achievements in this area, I developed a methodology for instant ranking of key financial market influencers, which will be used for real-time monitoring. Utilized NLP and Topic modeling and classification, labeling and ranking topics within documents.

FitnessGenes (formerly MuscleGenes Ltd) was founded July 2013 by Dr Samantha Decombel PhD (Birmingham), Dr.Dan Reardon MD, Dr Stuart Grice PhD (Oxford), and Mark Gilbert CISSN. An initial conversation at a mutual friend’s wedding led to the research-and-development project that is now FitnessGenes. With over £5M of investment raised to date, and our first peer-reviewed paper recently published in the Journel of Obesity (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jobe/2018/7560707/) FitnessGenes is staying true to its academic roots, and leading the world of fitness genetics.

We use the combination of people’s DNA and their environmental circumstances to provide proactive lifestyle recommendations to help achieve fitness goals, rather than simply identifying health risks. FitnessGenes tests and services are designed to empower people, not to scare them.
 
The FitnessGenes team have a strong ethical code of practice to ensure their product is in keeping with their own beliefs. FitnessGenes do not believe genetic testing can be used for athlete selection, and therefore do not test under 18s. FitnessGenes believe everyone should own their genetic data, and therefore have an opt-out clause for all customers wishing not to participate in future research. FitnessGenes believe this information should be shared with carefully vetted academic communities for the advancement of science and human health.

I am the Founder and MD of PlayDNA, the only DNA Art company that provides beautiful, hand-crafted DNA Portraits with meaning. We combine the highest quality fine art media with modern molecular genetic techniques creating an original masterpiece based on your very own DNA. You can literally show the world what you’re made of! 

I set up PlayDNA in 2010 after coming across the concept of DNA artwork through a friend. Having researched the market on DNA art I decided I could use my molecular biology expertise to bring something new to the field, something that I hoped would excite and entertain people, and encourage them to learn more about genetics. As a result, PlayDNA Ltd was established. 

My successes with PlayDNA have been featured in publications as diverse as Forbes magazine, Lab Times and BBC radio, and I even ventured into the BBC2 Dragons Den itself. Although not successful in securing funding from the dragons, Peter Jones was a declared fan of the artwork!

Want to know if you’re an early bird or night owl, or if you have the genes of an Olympic sprinter? Your PlayDNA artwork will give you the answers. Not only do you receive a unique, contemporary and beautiful piece of bespoke artwork, but you also get a detailed analysis of your genetic profile. Two packages are currently available: Personal or Sports.

1. Studying shocks and turbulence in merging galaxy clusters using a network of radio telescopes and interferometers such as Very Large Array, VLA. We look for radio halo and mini halos as well as relics and turbulence driven shock fronts in merging systems of galaxy clusters.   
2. A statistical study of the magnetic field and polarization in different galaxy populations. We used the S-band Polarization All Sky Survey conducted by the Australian Parkes radio telescope and cross-matched the catalog with the NVSS radio survey at 1.4 GHz. We performed an extensive statistical study of multiple quantities such as Faraday rotation measure and de-polarization of the extragalactic radio sources. The published journal article and the resulted catalog can be found here: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/5/meta#  
3. Ionizing emissivity from galaxies at z ~ 3: Differences in field versus cluster galaxy populations. We used a custom made filter on the Palomar telescope as well as 10 years of deep archival Subaru data in multiple bands to identify galaxies with excess of Lyman Alpha emission and measure the escape fraction of the ionizing radiation.

NASA Frontier Development Lab (NASA-FDL) is an applied research accelerator designed to enhance nasa’s capability set by matching emerging talent from academia with peers and technologies within the private sector.
NASA-FDL is partnered with the NVIDIA, Autodesk and the SETI institute and  had brought post-grad researchers, with significant backing from industry and bolstered by feedback loops with experts from Planetary Science and data science, to focus their talents on tightly defined questions surrounding asteroid detection, characterization and mitigation issues. 
Here is the description of our team project:
New Approaches For Asteroid Spin State and Shape Modeling From Delay-Doppler Radar Images
Delay-Doppler radar imaging is a powerful technique to characterize the trajectories, shapes, and spin states of near-Earth asteroids; and has yielded detailed models of dozens of objects.  Reconstructing objects’ shapes and spins from delay-Doppler data is a computationally intensive inversion problem. Since the 1990s, delay-Doppler data has been analyzed using the SHAPE software. We have explored two new techniques to better automate delay-Doppler shape modeling: Bayesian optimization and a machine-learning neural network.
We have implemented a Bayesian optimization routine that uses SHAPE to autonomously search the space of spin-state parameters. Bayesian optimization yielded similar spin state constraints within a factor of 3 less computer runtime.
The shape modeling process could be further accelerated using a deep neural network to replace iterative fitting.  We have implemented a neural network with a Variational Auto-encoder (VAE), using a subset of known asteroid shapes and a large set of synthetic radar images as inputs to train the network. Conditioning the VAE in this manner allows the user to give the network a set of radar images and get a 3D shape model as an output.","Graduate Teaching Assistant, University of Minnesota, 2013-2013

Eigengene develops proprietary AI, and uses it to analyze cancer whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, in order to develop (i) personalized prognostics and diagnostics, and (ii) novel therapeutics.

Our algorithms do what no others can, namely, simultaneously find both the similarities and dissimilarities across multiple and diverse high-dimensional datasets, known as tensors. This enables them to find what other methods miss. For example, in cancer genomic data, our algorithms were able to identify multi-hundred-thousand marker DNA signatures that predict a patient’s survival and response to treatment. Our algorithms can scale to petabyte-sized datasets, yet are sensitive enough to detect meaningful patterns in cohorts of as few as 250 patients, each with a genomic profile of billions of nucleotides. This enables us to tap the full wealth of information that sequencing the whole genome provides. Most other methods have difficulty finding patterns in such “skinny” datasets, in which the number of measured attributes per patient is far greater than the number of patients. However, they are the norm in cancer genomics.

We analyze DNA copy-number profiles, which can be measured far more reliably than the more usually used RNA expression. The fact that our signatures comprise hundreds of thousands of markers makes them robust to measurement errors. Our signatures predict novel drug targets that correlate with patients’ outcome.

","Principal, Rising Arc Marketing, 2015-2018
By the end of 2015 I was spending the majority of my time in some form of marketing activity. I had grown a small customer base while working full-time in talent acquisition and recruiting. At the holiday break I decided to open an agency. 

While there was some experimentation and finding my path over the first several months, I found my level at the delivery end of the content marketing process through on page SEO optimzation, a range of off-site growth tactics and extending the life of content through social media growth strategies. One of the most rewarding accomplishments came from an extended period of deeply studying the MarTech space and developing a deep understanding of the tools marketplace across a range of marketing related industry segments. This allowed me to develop a plan and work with a small team of developers to build a tools set that includes custom designed tools.

Our marketing functions are two-fold: branding our team as a viable sports entertainment alternative within our community and delivering the maximum possible return on the investment our sponsors and advertisers make in our team. 

Our basketball functions are led by one of the brightest young coaches in our region. Anthony Leonelli is our Director of Player Personnel and Head Basketball Coach. 

Our team will measure success against the following goals that I've established: 

1. Deliver return-on-investment to the businesses who partner, sponsor and invest in the
marketing opportunities the Anchors provide.
2. Select and attract players by providing the development opportunities to compete at the
next level
3. Be agents of service to our local communities and community organizations that serve
them.
4. Provide our fans an entertaining, family friendly product that exists in a culture of winning.
5. Develop an interactive, multi-media rich internet experience at the leading edge of anywhere
in sports.

I'd become interested in the area after seeing companies, teams, etc. repeat the same avoidable mistakes when they don't put the effort in to understand how their models behave at scale---occasionally resulting in staggering catastrophes, like the 2007 mortgage crisis, or accidentally shipping 'anti recommenders' which make the worst possible recommendations out to customers.

My responsibilities include writing big data jobs in scalding, and building the library code related to running and testing them. I write and maintain the code that handles the business logic on the ETL side, all in scala. I also write and maintain utility scripts which are designed to make working on hadoop as user-friendly to fellow engineers and analysts as possible. Originally, when I joined Etsy, all of big data was based upon cascading.jruby and Java. I was involved in the transition from cascading.jruby to scalding. Some of my time is also spent doing ad-hoc analysis using sql/scalding, and in training fellow employees to be more effective on the hadoop cluster.

We recently rewrote our entire event-logging and ETL pipeline to incorporate Kafka. I wrote the part that downloads data from Kafka to HDFS, also contributed to code that records event requests from the browser, and, finally, also to the middle layer between the webs and the Kafka cluster which is written in golang.

Some of my work falls under the category of improving data quality. I worked closely with analysts to reconcile data from the new event logging pipeline with the older system it replaced, fixing bugs and tweaking business logic as needed. Also lead an effort to help the internal platform team bring in-house metrics in line with what Appboy was reporting.

Chief of Research: Digital Cognitive Models

Digital Cognitive Models (DCM) integrate Data Science and Big Data with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Commonsense Reasoning. Our system incorporates massive databases (textual, numerical, social network data etc) and utilizes various analytical methods to process the data into a DCM, a next level scenario analysis tool.

A DCM describes the context and meaning of data, processes and causalities as a heuristic network and cognitive model providing a deeper understanding of what is happening, why and how it is happening, and most importantly - where it could lead. It provides both backwards and forwards analysis of any scenario in context with real world situation based on three realms: industrial-economical, political-governmental and socio-emotional.","Big Data and Analytics Architect, Rammin'Speed Entertainment Ltd, 2015-2017

Project lead in a research and development project.

Our objective is to finalize a medical decision support system with automated machine learning technology, which develops predictive and causally descriptive models of factors involved in triggering and progress of various diseases. Our primary focus is on Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. The system uses machine learning technology to extract information about factors involved in this process and their interactions, to present them as disease progression models and to adapt these models to newly acquired data. It also provides a possibility of in silico testing for individual prognosis or new hypothesis. In this system we especially focus on finding the early events involved in activation of the disease in focus.

System uses both SQL databases and Big Data technologies (Hadoop, HBase, Mahout, MongoDB) to acquire and store data, a custom built user interface based on PHP and JQuery. Analysis of data is performed with Python, R and Java.

System analyses data to extract key factors and interactions from recorded variables, and then devises triggering and progress causalities using various machine learning methods. Results are expressed as predictive and descriptive progression models for the disease in focus. These computer-made progression models will be continuously self-improving by new follow-up data using machine learning technologies, and will be able to adapt to new findings and perspectives on development of various health related factors. Human experts will be able to add their own prognosis in the form of a user defined progression model based on their beliefs on the etiopathogenesis and functional development of the disease in focus.

System incorporates several novel algorithms and original research to extract predictive and descriptive models using machine learning and natural language processing.","Research Supervisor of Data Science, Data Analytics and Big Data, FuturaVis Foundation, 2013-2015","Data Scientist, FuturaVis Foundation, 2013-2013","System Architect, University of Turku, 2005-2012","Data Scientist, University of Turku, 2005-2012","Research Scientist, University of Turku, 2004-2012","Research Assistant, University of Turku, 2002-2004","Lecturer, University of Turku, 2003-2003","Assistant, University of Turku, 2002-2002","Application developer (EXT), Nokia Siemens Networks, 2000-2001",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Accumulo, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Hadoop, HBase, Impala, Java, Linux, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, Python, R","Master of Science, Information Technology, University of Turku, 2001-2004","Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Computer Science, University of Turku","Master of Science, University of Turku, 2001-2004","Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), University of Turku",,,,,,,,,,

• Statistical analysis, review and visualisation frameworks for the data used for estimating pricing model parameters, and for quantifying the impact of using alternative data sources.

• Systematic identification of the risks present in a trade before execution (i.e. pre-trade analysis), and making sure these are captured and priced accordingly.","Manager - Credit-Exposure Analytics, Standard Bank, 2010-2012

I decided to settle with Ab.D. (All But Dissertation) at final stage of my Ph.D. studies in Artificial Intelligence program at UPC. The title of my thesis proposal was: An intelligent remote monitoring and prediction system for major depression. My thesis research contains two main parts:
In the first part, I have been mainly focused on design and development of a qualitative rule-based model relying on clinical literature and opinion of mental health experts to provide clinical support for patients with major depression. Then implemented the model as a rule engine for the android app and web app that was dedicated to monitor patients with major depression. This part of the thesis was a collaboration between the lab I belonged, SOCO (soft computing research group at UPC) and psychiatry and psychology research group at Hospital San Juan De Deu, Barcelona. 

As a member of Soft Computing group at Computer Science department, my work in the area of soft computing is mainly focused on ""Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning Methodology as classifier"". The main objective was to design and develop an enhanced classifier for imbalanced datasets based on Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning Methodology and apply it to psychological monitoring data of patients with Depression. 
My main area of interest is classification problems in real world medical applications with highly imbalanced datasets containing rare cases.

Josh,Mills,"Senior Consultant, Data Science",Nationwide,"Columbus, OH, United States","Consultant, Data Science, Nationwide Insurance, 2015-
I currently serve a number of roles within the Customer Insights & Analytics group. My primary role focuses on building and deploying predictive models. As an advanced data product manager, I'm involved in each part of the modeling effort, including acquiring and processing data, building, testing, and validating models, synthesizing the key findings and presenting the results to key business partners, and designing and testing the deployment of models to front-end associates.

In addition to my modeling role, I also work with internal and external business partners to design and deploy analytic dashboards through the Tableau Server platform. I also provide technical consulting for Tableau for multiple partners across the enterprise, and together with my colleagues, I've led several introductory training sessions for Tableau.

KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
•	Led a small team to develop and update a suite of models to identify customers who would be significantly impacted by servicing channel changes using lasso logistic regression and ensemble decision trees. Model recommendations have helped improve retention of impacted customers by 5%.

•	Played a significant role in building and evaluating enterprise marketing mix model using hierarchical Bayesian methods based in R encompassing several distribution channels, marketing tactics (e.g. pay-per-click advertising, TV commercials) and sales funnel metrics (e.g. prospective customers, new policies).

•	Built and deployed multiple predictive models for acquisition, cross-sell and retention activities using logistic regression and rational subgroups with custom-crafted resampling techniques.

•	Recruited and led several data science interns with diverse academic backgrounds. Provided regular feedback and performance reviews and 1:1 mentoring.","Specialist, Data Science, Nationwide Insurance, 2013-2015
My role in Customer Analytics involved a mix of statistical consulting for different parts of the business, building and deploying large-scale predictive models, and utilizing ETL techniques to combine data from multiple relational databases. I've also used Tableau to build and deploy analytic dashboards (through Tableau Server) and to create reports used for portfolio and workload management.

My recent modeling work has ranged from individual customer churn/retention propensity modeling to prediction of overall demand generated by marketing spend across different traditional and digital outlets (Marketing Mix Modeling).

Much of my work involves building partnerships with both internal and external clients to identify and tackle complex business problems using a rigorous analytical framework.","Specialist, Market Analytics, Nationwide Insurance, 2010-2013
I work in Customer Analytics on the Predictive Analytics & Modeling team, where I use a combination of statistical modeling techniques, data management and ETL skills, and data visualization software to meet the business needs of internal clients.","Graduate Research Assistant, Purdue University, 2006-2010

Also developed interview protocols for state-funded study on data collection techniques.

•	Co-authored major research proposals to cutting-edge USDOT research center.

•	Presented research findings at multiple major professional conferences including the Transportation Research Board Annual Meetings, North American Meetings of the Regional Science Association International, Transportation Research Forum, and the World Conference of the Spatial Econometrics Association.
